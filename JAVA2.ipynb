    "Certainly! Here are the answers to your questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ’¡ **Q1. What are the Conditional Operators in Java?**\n",
    "- In Java, the conditional operators are:\n",
    "  1. `&&` (Logical AND): Returns true if both operands are true.\n",
    "  2. `||` (Logical OR): Returns true if either of the operands is true.\n",
    "  3. `!` (Logical NOT): Inverts the logical state of an operand.\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ’¡ **Q2. What are the types of operators based on the number of operands?**\n",
    "- Operators in Java can be classified into three types based on the number of operands they act upon:\n",
    "  1. Unary operators: Act on a single operand. Examples include `++` (increment), `--` (decrement), and `!` (logical NOT).\n",
    "  2. Binary operators: Act on two operands. Examples include `+` (addition), `-` (subtraction), `*` (multiplication), `/` (division), and `=` (assignment).\n",
    "  3. Ternary operator: Acts on three operands. The only ternary operator in Java is the conditional operator `? :`, also known as the \"ternary conditional operator.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ’¡ **Q3. What is the use of Switch case in Java programming?**\n",
    "- The `switch` statement in Java is used to select one of many code blocks to be executed based on the value of a variable or an expression. It provides an alternative to using multiple `if-else` statements. The `switch` statement evaluates the expression once and then matches the result with the corresponding case labels to determine which block of code to execute.\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ’¡ **Q4. What are the conditional statements and the use of conditional statements in Java?**\n",
    "- Conditional statements in Java allow you to control the flow of your program based on certain conditions. The two main conditional statements in Java are:\n",
    "  1. `if` statement: It executes a block of code if the specified condition is true.\n",
    "  2. `if-else` statement: It executes one block of code if the condition is true and another block if the condition is false.\n",
    "- Conditional statements are used to implement decision-making logic, perform different actions based on different conditions, and create more dynamic and flexible programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ’¡ **Q5. What is the syntax of the if-else statement?**\n",
    "The syntax of the if-else statement in Java is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "if (condition) {\n",
    "  // Code to execute if the condition is true\n",
    "} else {\n",
    "  // Code to execute if the condition is false\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ’¡ **Q6. How do you compare two strings in Java?**\n",
    "- In Java, you can compare two strings using the `equals()` method, which compares the contents of the strings. Here's an example:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "String str1 = \"Hello\";\n",
    "String str2 = \"World\";\n",
    "\n",
    "if (str1.equals(str2)) {\n",
    "    System.out.println(\"Strings are equal\");\n",
    "} else {\n",
    "    System.out.println(\"Strings are not equal\");\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ’¡ **Q7. What is a Mutable String in Java? Explain with an example.**\n",
    "- In Java, `String` objects are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed once they are created. However, there is a mutable alternative called `StringBuilder` (or `StringBuffer` for thread-safe operations) that allows modifying the content of a string.\n",
    "```java\n",
    "StringBuilder mutableString = new StringBuilder(\"Hello\");\n",
    "mutableString.append(\" World\");\n",
    "System.out.println(mutableString.toString());  // Output: Hello World\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ’¡ **Q8. Write a program to sort a String alphabetically.**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "import java.util.Arrays;\n",
    "\n",
    "public class StringSortExample {\n",
    "    public static void main(String[] args) {\n",
    "        String str = \"openai\";\n",
    "        char[] charArray = str.toCharArray();\n",
    "\n",
    "        Arrays.sort(charArray);\n",
    "\n",
    "        String sortedString = new String(charArray);\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"Sorted String: \" + sortedString);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ’¡ **Q9. Write a program to check if the letter 'e' is present in the word 'Umbrella'.**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class CheckLetterExample {\n",
    "    public static void main(String[] args) {\n",
    "        String word = \"Umbrella\";\n",
    "        boolean isPresent = false;\n",
    "\n",
    "        for (int i = 0; i < word.length(); i++) {\n",
    "            if (word.charAt(i) == 'e') {\n",
    "                isPresent = true;\n",
    "                break;\n",
    "            }\n",
    "        }\n",
    "\n",
    "        if (isPresent) {\n",
    "            System.out.println(\"The letter 'e' is present in the word.\");\n",
    "        } else {\n",
    "            System.out.println(\"The letter 'e' is not present in the word.\");\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ’¡ **Q10. Where exactly is the string constant pool located in the memory?**\n",
    "- The string constant pool is a part of the JVM's runtime data area and is located in the method area. It stores all the literal strings and string objects that are created using string literals. The string constant pool is a separate area in memory where strings are stored and shared to optimize memory usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "I hope these answers clarify your questions. If you have any further queries, feel free to ask!"
