    "In Python, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. When an exception occurs, the program's normal execution is halted, and the control is transferred to a special code block known as an exception handler. Exception handling allows you to catch and handle these exceptional events gracefully, preventing the program from crashing or producing unexpected results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions can occur for various reasons, such as trying to access a non-existent variable, dividing a number by zero, or attempting to open a file that doesn't exist. Python provides a mechanism to handle different types of exceptions using try-except blocks. The code inside the try block is monitored for exceptions, and if any exception occurs, it is caught by the corresponding except block, where you can handle the exception appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax errors, on the other hand, are a type of error that occurs when the Python interpreter encounters code that violates the language's syntax rules. These errors typically happen during the parsing phase, before the program is executed. Syntax errors indicate that there is a mistake in the structure or formatting of the code, such as missing parentheses, incorrect indentation, or using an invalid keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between exceptions and syntax errors is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Timing: Syntax errors are caught by the Python interpreter during the parsing phase, before the program is executed. Exceptions, on the other hand, occur during the execution of the program when an exceptional condition arises.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Cause: Syntax errors are caused by violating the syntax rules of the Python language. Exceptions, on the other hand, are caused by exceptional situations that can occur during program execution, such as invalid input, file not found, or arithmetic errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Handling: Syntax errors cannot be caught and handled using try-except blocks because they occur before the program starts executing. However, exceptions can be caught and handled using try-except blocks to provide a graceful way of handling exceptional situations in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, syntax errors are mistakes in the structure or formatting of the code that prevent the program from running, while exceptions are exceptional events that occur during program execution and can be caught and handled using try-except blocks."

    "The `try-else` statement is used to specify a block of code that should be executed if no exceptions are raised within the `try` block. The `else` block is executed immediately after the `try` block completes successfully. Here's an example:\n",

    "    # Code to execute if no exceptions are raised\n",

If no exception is raised, the `else` block is executed, which displays the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `try-finally` statement:\n",
    "The `try-finally` statement is used to define a block of code that must be executed regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. The `finally` block is executed right after the `try` block, regardless of whether an exception was raised or caught. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",

    "\n",
    "3. `raise` statement:\n",
    "The `raise` statement is used to explicitly raise an exception in Python. It allows you to throw custom exceptions or re-raise exceptions that were caught but need to be propagated further. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # Code that might raise an exception\n",

    "Example:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    age = int(input(\"Enter your age: \"))\n",
    "    if age < 0:\n",
    "        raise ValueError(\"Age cannot be negative.\")\n",
    "except ValueError as ve:\n",
    "    print(\"Error:\", str(ve))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `try` block gets input for the user's age and raises a `ValueError` if the age is negative. The `except` block catches the `ValueError` and displays the error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `try-else`, `try-finally`, and `raise` statements provide additional control and flexibility in handling exceptions in Python, allowing you to execute specific code paths based on whether an exception occurred or to explicitly raise exceptions when needed."

The exception class takes the `balance` and `amount` as parameters and provides a custom error message using those values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `withdraw_amount` function checks if the withdrawal amount is greater than the balance and raises a `WithdrawalError` if it is. Otherwise, it prints a success message.\n",
